# Wasted-Time

Welcome to Wasted Time. I built this application because I started working on this project last semester in college.
I couldn't figure out how to do it, then eventually I said enough is enough and I had to finish it.
I loved the idea, and wanted to prove to myself I could do it. I hope you enjoy it! It's one of my favorite projects!

I used Moment.js for time calculations. It made it so much easier!
